        <h4><u>”Failing to Plan is Planning to Fail.”</u></h4>
        <p>A new start. It feels good, I have a system, and I see good things in the future. So, I recently started listening to some Hawaiian Music. I saw a reel on where UH students were saying their favorite Hawaiian songs. That was the start. I actually hated listening to Hawaiian Music when I was there. Now that I’m away, when I listen to it now it brings me back. The sences are a cool feature of being human. A smell, feeling, or sound can bring back memories more vividly than just trying to remember. I feel like I can feel the Aloha around me, feel the breeze with the sun, and the calmness of being happy, safe, and loved. My dad was there, when I was there. I honestly don’t think I really got over losing him. I still miss him so much. Everytime I forget something and I have to go back home. I can feel him sitting there on the other side of the door for a split second with a grin on his face about to say, “Welcome back what we forget this time?” Because before I left the first time he always said, “I’ll see you soon.” Because he knew I’d forget something even if it was as simple as some gum, keys, phone, or gym clothes, water bottle, anything. I know he’d be a little disappointed at me if I was being real. Shit, I was a personal trainer, hiker, and party animal. Now I’m a manager, fat, and away from mom. He’d want me to be with her. But there are things that happened, young and dumb Joe, and stupid life. I just hope I can one day make him proud. 
Back to the here and now. I fixed the photo problem. What else do I want to do with it. I’d like to write articles, and have them swipe from the sides if possible; possibly use CSS to do it. I want to make this the simplest it can be but with a clean look, and use. I’d really like the content to speak for the site. The content is me and I wishfully hope that it can bring and keep people here. Add a little voting sections, maybe. To start, and if I can do a questionaire, or quiz. Other pages would make it more. What to put on those pages? TBD. LOL. OMG. IYKYK. LMAO. 
A quote says, Fail to plan, then you are planning to fail. We got ideas for the website. I need to workout. I remember a coworker at one of the gyms I worked at saying to his client, “Sometime you just gotta do something. If you’re sitting on the couch and I pop in your head, get up and do 10 squats. Do something. As I’m sitting here typing this I am gettting up randomly to do some squats. hahaha. But I’d like to wake up early, stretch for 15-20min, then roll for 10-15min., and maybe some dynamic movements like lunges, bird dogs (I think), planks, supermans, and runner strides. Sometime throughout the day I’d love to workout, and some cardio, and stretch/roll. 
Next, try and pick up my spanish learning with some flash cards before bed maybe mixed with some yoga. They say yoga before bed is a deeper sleep. Also, one youtube video, and/or using it more with my roommate. Stay on top of my sign language too, just one a day should keep me good, its like 30-40min. long. 
Finally, stop spending money, think about the future, what’s next for me. Cook from home will help and add to my qualities for marriage. JK. LOL. Try home workouts, outside workout, just try to not do the gym membership till I can afford it. 
I’d like to know how to really get my site on the web, like pay and pick for a name, and where I should post it, and everything that is involved with that. </p>

        <h4><u>Hard Work Beats Talent</u></h4>
        <p>Another day off. Typical chess. I was feeling myself. Thinking things thru, clock was moving slow for me, the seconds were ticking like minutes. Working on this and it going sideways is throwing my off a bit. Still trying to add these pictures. I need some sort of background to catch the eye, per say. Watching some TV. Got a 10 day free trial. I'm a huge ESPN fan, and love the shows. IDK if I like it more because I haven't seen it in a while or it never gets old. Sports, Sports, Sports. I LOVE THEM. The stats, pride, warriorness, and the unpredictablity.</p>

        <h4><u>Another Day. Another Dollar</u></h4>
        <p>That's what some people say. Working on the website. Working on life. I'm still sore as anything, this old age thing is really sinking in. I thought it was just temperary. LOL. I wanted to add some other features before I start polishing the edges, but I'm not a hundred percent sure what. On another note, my roommate fixed the tub. The hot water valve wasn't closing the water all the way. This is now the third time it happend. First time was what we moved into. This thing was leaking from day one. My roommate fixed it. A month or so later, he leaves for a personal vacation. I'm taking a shower on the like the fourth day. I turn off the water, I turn it a little tighter because it started leaking lately. The whole thing pops outs the wall and the water won't stop coming out. My phone at the time was spazing out and wouldn't make calls. Luckily he answers the text within 15min. He calls me, I can answer calls, but not make them. He calls the office, and finds a plumber to fix it. I was late to work. Mind you this was at 6 something in the morning because I had an early shift that day. Obviously I was late to work and showed up two to three hours late. It started up again a week or so back. Today it got worse and was just on a slow run. I'm blessed to have a roommate that can fix it because our complex takes forever to handle work orders, if they show up at all. I got stories for days about this place. They got me though. I was by myself, first time moving out of state, and finding my own place to live. This place was the closest to my job, I could afford it if my roommate can pay half. There was high hopes, especially after he was offered a job as the the maintanence manager here. Plus, if it wasn't for that, we might not have gotten a washer and dryer. My roommate put in our own washer and dryer. We didn't have one for the first month. The second week they gave us the keys to a unit that was empty with a washer and dryer. I didn't complain, it was somethign to complain about, and it was a discomfort in less of a better word. I was worried though, because with something like this, if they management crew hates you, then they will drag their feet for any work orders that need to get done, or if you need them they will call you back last. So, I try and not make waves with people in those types of postions. Today, I went to play chess. There were two women there. Which was very new to me for this chess club. But it was a breathe of fresh air. They were lovely to play with even though they were quite new to the game. It honestly made me feel good that I could help them, and make the game even harder for me too. I need a Nightly with Mongo photo, and a Philly things photo. Maybe have a sayings sections for each entry that deserves one. Later like third time I work on this or something, but I need to have at least two different sizes if not three.</p>

        <h4><u>Thank you for sunshine. Thank you for rain.</u></h4>
        <p>I is going to be a great day. Full of fun, activities, and progress. I want to be better, I will try to be better, and I will plan to be better. My body is my temple, my mind, body, and soul need to be cleansed and united as one. Every saying in the book and all the motivation is needed for progression. I will hit speed bumps, I will feel like I hit a wall, and I will take a step back before I take two forward. But it's one step, one punch, and one round at a time. Things will get better but not because it got easy it'll be because I got stronger.</p>

        <h4><u>God Gives Us Nothing We Can't Handle</u></h4>
        <p>It's been a rough one. Which means it's time to level up! God gives us nothing we can't handle. Things don't get easy, we get stronger. I can/will do everything, it'll make we stronger, sharper, and better me. Leveling up ain't supposed to be easy, and its all about the journey not the destination. Work is work. LOL! IYKYK. I miss my dad. Phillip Davido. He always knew something, about everything. He even was getting technology. His cameras, printer, and laptop. Him sitting on the "stoop" watching the neighborhood, looking at emails, and news. One way our family describes him is, a man amougst men. Which means to us, in a room full of good men, my dad stands up to lead them. The most humble, respectful, natural smarts, and most loving man my mother could be given on this earth. Thank you God for the time that he gave Dad to me and my family. He changed permanently for the best. The facts in our lives that make us strong, the "things" we stand for, and the memories that shape our personanlities; these are the qualities that make a real person, parts of their soul, and the interworkings of their WHY. I'm grateful for mine, the good and the bad, the pain and joy also, the "hard work" for the "reward". The purpose to life might be to enjoy the journey not destinations, or check points. They are just places, and moments. Enjoy the whole movie, or the whole TV collection of seasons. Nothing stays the same, and you have more power than you can imagine. I'm hungry, need a break, by back is killing me along with my neck. I started playing basketball a few days ago, along with frisbee golf which took my whole chest, bicep stretched to the max. I'll be back, I need to update the sports side. P.s. my sign language ain't no joke no moe. lol </p>

        <h4><u>Jump In With Two Feet</u></h4>
        <p>Three month aversary for Santa Fe and I. It's been a wild time, not boring at all. Full of actions and adventure in scenses not first thought of and in the logical scenses. Tonight though, my sarcadian rhythm is so thrown off from the past two nights going to sleep before Eleven at night. I've woken up at five thirty in the morning, and tonight twelve thirty in the morning. I tried to go back to sleep. Couldn't. Went to get food and etc., nothing helped. I decided to start coding since my ass needs to be at work at six in the morning to let the floor guy in. Yes, I will get an energy drink, and Yes, I will be productive.</p>

        <p>Excited for the season. Preseason means absolutely nothing as long as no injuries. We need our guys in game shape, and rhythm. But health IS the MOST important thing to us. We have the most dominant big man in the league today. He scores more than the minutes he has. The dude is insane. He does what he wants, when he wants. Then we added PG8 now. This man is a vet that has battled with Lebron, Curry, the big 3 in Boston, and he's played with Kawahi, Westbrook, Harden, and Carmelo Anthony. He will help in crucial moments when we lacked help with leadership, and calm, cool, killa instinct. We were gifted a future Point Guard Hall of Famer in Maxey. Mr. Ice cold killa in Madison Square Garden. This dude is made out of Franchise Changing material. We add some youth, with finals experience in Caleb, and we added a well missed, and needed back up center in Andre, who is an acrobatic, fun hearted, and all around skilled big man in is own right. You don't know how much I love and missed Mr. Drummond. The Future is bright, the hopes are high, and the ride will be wild this season for OUR Philadelphia 76ers.</p>

        <p>Our Big Three. Did we ever think we would get here one day? We always knew we would have a number one, and maybe an up and coming prospect. But NOW! We have a ligitimate Big Three now I feel established All Stars, PG8, Mad Maxey, The Process Embiid. It's a win now phase which comes with a lot of pressure, but these guys laught in the pressure. All three of these guys have gone thru their own problems in life to make them resilent. PG with Indian Playoffs, wack centers, Clipper... enough said lol. Maxey droppping in the draft, luckily to us, These past years with Embiid gettting injuried in the season, and the playoff experience that hasn't been happy, which makes him the hungriest youngest mother fucker out ther. Embiid. Nothing needed.</p>

        <p>Eagles get a win! 3-2. A.J. Brown is back! Boy oh boy we missed him. Yes it was the Browns, but watching the game you could he was the comfort blanket that the team was missing. We also saw who's team this is. The game leader. A.J. Brown 116 yards, Saquon who I love, but 47 rushing yards. 2-0 with A.J. Do you need more? Jalen Hurts 264 yards, and 2 TDs. His game elevated. Going into the bye with a W, and getting off of a bye, we are 4-0 with Jalen Hurts at the helm. Consistancy is the problem with us Eagles, but keeping that consistancy ain't bad.</p>

        <p>Eagles are struggling now. We are 2-2. Bad, bad, very bad lose to the Bucs. I know we were down players, leaders, but we should of focused on our weapons that are on the field. We got all these weapons for this momment of the season when injuries come into affect. We easily have top 10 in all the skilled positions, RB, WR, WR2, TE, QB, Ts, C, but we either have an injury in those postions or they are under performing. The whole league, the world, knows that these players can play better.</p>
