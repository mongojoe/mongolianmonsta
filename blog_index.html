         <h4><u>”Hello Cousin”</u></h4>
         <p>Today was an interesting day. I met a dude who told me, “He are you Joe?” I said, “Yea.” and with a little curiosity,” Why do you ask?” He said he had gone into a restaurant, and another place I can’t remember calling out to him, “Joe. Joe.” Then walking up to him saying, “ Oh you look just like this guy I know that is Mongolian.” This guy turns out to be full Mongolian. He said it was just very strange that it happened multiple times. I was so shocked, found it humorous, and felt like I found a long lost cousin. We had a lot in common. He is from a similar city attitude, he moved to the west coast, I just moved to the far west coast to Hawaii, he didn’t. He was a personal trainer, but he was a way way better one. Nonsense stuff but cool that it just came up in conversation and we just so happen to have both done it. I know I’m also reaching but doesn’t it fell nice to connect and to connect to a fellow Mongolian. We are not like other races where you can run into each other, or just always see a familiar looking face. I feel blessed to have met so many different Mongolians, especially ones that are not related to me, or came over on the same boat over seventy years ago.</p>
         <p>I finally got some feedback about my website from someone. They said it was a little difficult to read, and should be more user readable. So I just made the background straight white, but I felt like I was blocking the beautiful city of Philadelphia. Next, thought to separate the articles so you can see part of the background, and as you scroll you will see the whole background. I want to make the page more interactive for y'all instead of only just me, myself, and I. I’m thinking of quizzes, but it seems a little too intricate. Maybe just a fun simple quiz. No results, or leader board yet. Just something to go through. I can change it up once a week. </p>
         <p>Sooooo, I didn’t make a video today, I didn’t edit last night’s video. I will workout, I’m tired. It’s been a long week for me. Many hours. It’s hard work making money. I need to do more yoga. Yoga tonight. Put on the headphones and play some smooth music. Then put on Youtube beginner yoga. I can just follow and not think, just chill with the music, and “play Simon Says” with Youtube. Lmao.</p>
         <p>Waking up to texts about the weather restricting them, warming up my car, dusting off the snow from my car, and driving cautiously to work was so fun and reminiscing of my past. Maybe it’s because I’m a big guy, and the whole time I was in the desert I wanted to just be in the A/C, I am totally enjoying this weather! It is phenomenal.</p>
         <h5>Nov. 6th, 2024</h5>
         <h4><u>Finally!!! Snow!!!</u></h4>
         <p>Seventeen years, I haven’t seen snow. I like saw it in Las Vegas, but it didn’t really stick, and it didn’t do anything. Today was day one, of a potential three day “snow storm”. It snowed two days ago but it didn’t stick on the ground, it only stuck to cars, and once you brushed it on the ground it melted, due to the ground being wet also. But today it was non stop snowing, and the flakes were huge. I had to buy a new jacket, I didn’t have a winter jacket. Also a brush with a scrapper even though I won’t use the scrapper because I don’t want to damage the window. I still don’t have heat in my apt. which it is what it is. I glad and sad that I’m a big guy. LOL. Snow is so amazing, I love the smell, chill in the air, and the childhood memories coming back. I hope I can make it to work, my apartment kind of sucks, meaning I hope we get plowed out. Today, since I worked a long shift, my car just sat there during this whole thing… After work I have to dust off my car, and warm it up. It was fun. Lol. The home internet doesn’t work though :( so I’m coding, and listening to music.</p>
         <p>My mom texted me today. It made me feel good. I miss her a lot. I do plan on going this summer to see her. I have a lot of vacation hours I can use and I NEED to see my family in the land of paradise. It would honestly mean the world to me. I hope to have this going with Insta, and email, connecting with yall. The smell of the ocean, the wind on my check, and the sight of those mountains. The feel of the Aloha! I do miss that too. Giving my Mom a hug is number one on that list. I got a little more than six months. I think I can do a little transformation. Come along for the ride!!!</p>
         <p>I put a link at the bottom with my get at me things. Next I want to make something like a trivia. I got one written but I’m not sure if it allows the php with the free version, and I know nothing about php. On another note, Tonight’s workout, also the first workout to be put on this jawn, is going to be simple, because KISS. Keep It Simple Stupid. Squats (20), Push Ups (10), Leg Ups (10), Mountain Climber (10 each leg). Three Sets. I’ll probably post it tomorrow or the next day. I will also do a cooking one tomorrow. I have no idea what I’m cooking but my stomach will tell me when the time is right. Let’s do this!!! Gametime! Yeah! Yeah!</p>
         <h5>Nov. 5th, 2024</h5>
         <h4><u>”Inside My Mind, Trying to Get Things Right”</u></h4>
         <p>I added a link to send me an email, and to visit my Instagram. I ain’t got nothing on Instagram NOW but there will be. LOL. But for real, I think I’m going to do a picture a day or something like that just to get something on there. I do want it to be good content so planning and maybe even skits, I’ve always wanted to put together a little show of my own. IDK. We Will See. Also, the Eagles game was nerve racking and the plays were outstanding which don’t usually go together. I’m seeing real progress I feel, but I’m also waiting for the “shoe to drop” per say. I don’t want to focus on it either. Gotta look through the front window.</p>
         <p>I gotta get ready for work soon. Going to be another long week. P.s. It snowed yesterday. Which was amazing. The snow wasn’t sticking but OMG the flakes were like tiny snowball, for how big they were. It was pretty. What would have made it beautiful would have been if it stuck. It’s supposed to snow tomorrow and for three days straight. I hope one of those days it’ll stick. We will see. Please send me something, follow me on Instagram, show me what you think, or even feed back of course. I want to continue to take this to the next level. To all the followers that continue to read and keep up, make yourself heard. I want to interact with yall on this new platform I am trying to create. I will continue to work on it. Please don’t give up on me and I won’t give up on yall. I’m really believing in that movie, “If you build it they will come”.</p>
         <p>Hobbies. They keep us busy and involved in life, and joy/accomplishments. They come and go, but I need to be more disciplined in maintaining them and evolving them. I have coding, sports, basketball in particular I play in my free time, but I’m totally open to other sports. Recently I tried frisbee golf. It was fun! I ended up playing a few more times. I’m trying to teach myself ASL, and Spanish. I want to get back into working out. I stretch daily. Everyone should have multiple hobbies, or at least, rotate them monthly, yearly, decadely. LOL Whatever, just have them and remember “Too much of one thing isn’t good.”</p>
         <h5>Oct. 30, 2024</h5>
         <h4><u>”The Future is here, The Future is now.”</u></h4>
         <p>Obviously my new tag I learned didn’t work. SO, NOW, I’m going to try and approach this from a different angle. Hopefully this new way will change the game and add a better user experience. See I’m sounding like a coder already. LOL. J/K. Anyways, I do have work today, and I also know this is supposed to be Nightly with Mongo and I’ve been posting in the morning. Maybe I’ll change it to a Morning post, or, OR, I can ADD a morning segment. And you can see the two different styles if any, but there will be a different tense written. I’ll be talking about what will happen, or hopes happen, to what did happen, and how it happened. It’s a thought.</p>
         <p>This new way does change my code a little. There’s another approach I can take in my next entry. I still need to stretch, roll out, and shower before work. And it’s implied that I’m coding too. Por Supuesto.  What’s next to do? I’m changing it for pleasant reading. Do I add content, user input, or, merch lol. A t-shirt with me on it. For the dudes a close up, and for the dudets a shirtless pic. LMAO. Let me know what you think later, I’ll add a voting ballot. HAHAHA.</p>
         <p>We dream about tomorrow, but yesterday’s tomorrow is now! Today is the Sixers game against the Pistons. I want to write about it tonight. I think that’s doable. I know I can. Be what I want to be. IYKYK. P.s. The Yankees game shocked me. I’m happy they didn’t just roll over a give up. Also, let me know what you would think about a little vlog. I think that’ll be cool. Ideas are popping in my head like popcorn. This Pat Mcafee is a cool thing. My boy came out of left field, and has a video podcast that became a ESPN show. His set is hella cool too. Maybe one day. I’d love to do something like this. IDK about being the main guy, but I’d love to be a part of something like that.</p>
         <p>People like to talk about privilege. There’s so many things in our lives we take for granted, we expect it to be that way, and we don’t think about it. IDK which one is worse, but we as a whole need to start having these thoughts, think these things, and add a little philosophy to our lives. We put people, places, and things in a box without knowing. These ideas are easy, and hugely impactful for our society. We live in the land of the free, but it shouldn’t be like the Wild Wild West. We are civilized people, and an advanced country. Why are we acting so selfish, and spoiled when we came from people escaping prejudice, and wanting more for their lives. It needs to be more WE and less ME. Without knowledge we have no power, but know the difference between knowledge and wisdom, and perfection can’t be accomplished by ourselves, we can only achieve it together.</p>
         <h5>Oct. 28, 2024</h5>
         <h4><u>”When life hands you lemons”</u></h4>
         <p>I learned a new tag. It’s supposed to show the text just how it’s written. There were a few others. The cool part is that it’s just with simple HTML. The most I can squeeze out of it will be worth the juice because then I can use less of the others, and knowledge is power right? I don’t want to go back and change the previous code. It’s not laziness, it’s a showing of growth, and skill learned. I would love to look back on this and see it as a time capsule of what old Mongo was like, and how he grew. I’m looking forward to seeing what this will bring me in life, new skills, hobbies, and hopefully a feeling of accomplishment.
	So, today I woke up and I have a flat tire. Obviously I gotta use my spare tire to get around for a couple days till I get paid on Wednesday night. It’s the type of life I chose. I need to get better, but I am the only person to blame. You have to accept responsibility, and the consequences and joys that come with it. I honestly need all four tires to be brand new. I will get two, this paycheck and save to get the other two next paycheck. Oh yeah, did I mention this is my day off. I still had to go into work just to do some work things. Did I change my tire, no because my spare tire was flat. I walked to work. That philly mentality, you gotta do what you gotta do to get shit done. That’s how my day off is starting off. And ofcourse I don’t want to drive my car anywhere because I’m riding on a spare. You’re supposed to drive only for necessary reasons. Like work, to make money to fix the problem. You know what, live in the moment, enjoy your breaths, and make it count. What’s next? I have a few things I wanna try out and see what it looks like. But I do need to make my Eagles comments, and I need to catch up on what the Sixers have been doing lately.

         <h4><u>Happy Sunday Funday</u></h4>
         <p>Took me an hour to solve the problem I was having on the website. That made the satisfaction of success more satisfying. I love and hate the things I do. Life needs the two sides of the coin if you think about it. How can you enjoy the good if you never have bad. For the good gets boring and stale if it never changes, you didn’t earn it, or becomes numbing. My Great Aunt, my brothers and I called her, again the spelling is not right. Neina. There are family stories around her. One of the many things I remember and try to live by was, everything in moderation. She was big on trying everything and saying too much of one thing is no good. With life thats one of my goals. Don’t get too comfortable, try new environments, and say yes to opportunities. It’s very hard when those opportunities bring about a lot of change. Such as, moving away from family, meeting new friends, ending friendships, and learning new skills because when you start new things, there tends to be a learning curve. Knowing who I am, what my ancestry is, and dreaming of my future helps me stand on my own two feet in this world full of unpredictability. If you stand for nothing than you fall for everything. I got a lot of work to do today. One habit I need to stop is finishing work, and basically being finished with the day. Finishing work should be the start to my day, my life, and I can do anything. If I’m tired take a nap, or if I need to wake myself up then, hop in the shower (“be careful IYKYK), or start a workout. Movement is the key to getting the blood pumping, ,the heart going, and life. Change is a constant in life. Get used to it, make it your weapon, say yes to experiences. Your Life, it come through you. The world come at you, and its up to you to adjust your sails to the wind. Stay positive, be active, take the leap, and have fun. For you only live once, YOLO. To all of you, Love Love.</p>

         <h4><u>”Failing to Plan is Planning to Fail.”</u></h4>
         <p>A new start. It feels good, I have a system, and I see good things in the future. So, I recently started listening to some Hawaiian Music. I saw a reel on where UH students were saying their favorite Hawaiian songs. That was the start. I actually hated listening to Hawaiian Music when I was there. Now that I’m away, when I listen to it now it brings me back. The sences are a cool feature of being human. A smell, feeling, or sound can bring back memories more vividly than just trying to remember. I feel like I can feel the Aloha around me, feel the breeze with the sun, and the calmness of being happy, safe, and loved. My dad was there when I was there. I honestly don’t think I really got over losing him. I still miss him so much. Everytime I forget something I have to go back home. I can feel him sitting there on the other side of the door for a split second with a grin on his face about to say, “Welcome back what we forget this time?” Because before I left the first time he always said, “I’ll see you soon.” Because he knew I’d forget something even if it was as simple as some gum, keys, phone, or gym clothes, water bottle, anything. I know he’d be a little disappointed at me if I was being real. Shit, I was a personal trainer, hiker, and party animal. Now I’m a manager, fat, and away from mom. He’d want me to be with her. But there are things that happened, young and dumb Joe, and stupid life. I just hope I can one day make him proud. 
Back to the here and now. I fixed the photo problem. What else do I want to do with it? I’d like to write articles, and have them swipe from the sides if possible; possibly use CSS to do it. I want to make this the simplest it can be but with a clean look, and use. I’d really like the content to speak for the site. The content is me and I wishfully hope that it can bring and keep people here. Add a little voting sections, maybe. To start, and if I can do a questionnaire, or quiz. Other pages would make it more. What to put on those pages? TBD. LOL. OMG. IYKYK. LMAO. 
A quote says, Fail to plan, then you are planning to fail. We got ideas for the website. I need to workout. I remember a coworker at one of the gyms I worked at saying to his client, “Sometimes you just gotta do something. If you’re sitting on the couch and I pop in your head, get up and do 10 squats. Do something. As I’m sitting here typing this I am getting up randomly to do some squats. hahaha. But I’d like to wake up early, stretch for 15-20min, then roll for 10-15min., and maybe some dynamic movements like lunges, bird dogs (I think), planks, supermans, and runner strides. Sometime throughout the day I’d love to workout, and some cardio, and stretch/roll. 
Next, try and pick up my Spanish learning with some flash cards before bed, maybe mixed with some yoga. They say yoga before bed is a deeper sleep. Also, one youtube video, and/or using it more with my roommate. Stay on top of my sign language too, just one a day should keep me good, it's like 30-40min. long. 
Finally, stop spending money, think about the future, what’s next for me. Cook from home will help and add to my qualities for marriage. JK. LOL. Try home workouts, outside workout, just try to not do the gym membership till I can afford it. 
I’d like to know how to really get my site on the web, like pay and pick for a name, and where I should post it, and everything that is involved with that. </p>

         <h4><u>Hard Work Beats Talent</u></h4>
         <p>Another day off. Typical chess. I was feeling myself. Thinking things through, the clock was moving slow for me, the seconds were ticking like minutes. Working on this and it going sideways is throwing me off a bit. Still trying to add these pictures. I need some sort of background to catch the eye, per say. Watching some TV. Got a 10 day free trial. I'm a huge ESPN fan, and love the shows. IDK if I like it more because I haven't seen it in a while or it never gets old. Sports, Sports, Sports. I LOVE THEM. The stats, pride, warriorness, and the unpredictability.</p>
         <h5>Oct. 15, 2024</h5>
         <h4><u>”Another Day. Another Dollar”</u></h4>
         <p>That's what some people say. Working on the website. Working on life. I'm still sore as anything, this old age thing is really sinking in. I thought it was just temporary. LOL. I wanted to add some other features before I start polishing the edges, but I'm not a hundred percent sure what. On another note, my roommate fixed the tub. The hot water valve wasn't closing the water all the way. This is now the third time it happened. First time was what we moved into. This thing was leaking from day one. My roommate fixed it. A month or so later, he leaves for a personal vacation. I'm taking a shower on the fourth day. I turn off the water, I turn it a little tighter because it started leaking lately. The whole thing pops outs the wall and the water won't stop coming out. My phone at the time was spazzing out and wouldn't make calls. Luckily he answers the text within 15min. He calls me, I can answer calls, but not make them. He calls the office, and finds a plumber to fix it. I was late to work. Mind you this was at 6 something in the morning because I had an early shift that day. Obviously I was late to work and showed up two to three hours late. It started up again a week or so back. Today it got worse and was just on a slow run. I'm blessed to have a roommate that can fix it because our complex takes forever to handle work orders, if they show up at all. I got stories for days about this place. They got me though. I was by myself, first time moving out of state, and finding my own place to live. This place was the closest to my job, I could afford it if my roommate could pay half. There were high hopes, especially after he was offered a job as the maintenance manager here. Plus, if it wasn't for that, we might not have gotten a washer and dryer. My roommate put in our own washer and dryer. We didn't have one for the first month. The second week they gave us the keys to a unit that was empty with a washer and dryer. I didn't complain, it was something to complain about, and it was a discomfort in less of a better word. I was worried though, because with something like this, if they management crew hates you, then they will drag their feet for any work orders that need to get done, or if you need them they will call you back last. So, I try to not make waves with people in those types of positions. Today, I went to play chess. There were two women there. Which was very new to me for this chess club. But it was a breath of fresh air. They were lovely to play with even though they were quite new to the game. It honestly made me feel good that I could help them, and make the game even harder for me too. I need a Nightly with Mongo photo, and a Philly things photo. Maybe have a sayings section for each entry that deserves one. Later like third time I work on this or something, but I need to have at least two different sizes if not three.</p>

         <h4><u>”Thank you for sunshine. Thank you for rain.”</u></h4>
         <p>It is going to be a great day. Full of fun, activities, and progress. I want to be better, I will try to be better, and I will plan to be better. My body is my temple, my mind, body, and soul need to be cleansed and united as one. Every saying in the book and all the motivation is needed for progression. I will hit speed bumps, I will feel like I hit a wall, and I will take a step back before I take two forward. But it's one step, one punch, and one round at a time. Things will get better but not because it got easy it'll be because I got stronger.</p>

         <h4><u>”God Gives Us Nothing We Can't Handle”</u></h4>
         <p>It's been a rough one. Which means it's time to level up! God gives us nothing we can't handle. Things don't get easy, we get stronger. I can/will do everything, it'll make we stronger, sharper, and better me. Leveling up ain't supposed to be easy, and its all about the journey not the destination. Work is work. LOL! IYKYK. I miss my dad. Phillip Davido. He always knew something, about everything. He even was getting technology. His cameras, printer, and laptop. Him sitting on the "stoop" watching the neighborhood, looking at emails, and news. One way our family describes him is, a man amongst men. Which means to us, in a room full of good men, my dad stands up to lead them. The most humble, respectful, natural smarts, and most loving man my mother could be given on this earth. Thank you God for the time that he gave Dad to me and my family. He changed permanently for the best. The facts in our lives that make us strong, the "things" we stand for, and the memories that shape our personalities; these are the qualities that make a real person, parts of their soul, and the inner workings of their WHY. I'm grateful for mine, the good and the bad, the pain and joy also, the "hard work" for the "reward". The purpose of life might be to enjoy the journey, not destinations, or check points. They are just places, and moments. Enjoy the whole movie, or the whole TV collection of seasons. Nothing stays the same, and you have more power than you can imagine. I'm hungry, need a break, my back is killing me along with my neck. I started playing basketball a few days ago, along with frisbee golf which took my whole chest, bicep stretched to the max. I'll be back, I need to update the sports side. P.s. my sign language ain't no joke no moe. lol </p>

         <p>Three month aversary for Santa Fe and I. It's been a wild time, not boring at all. Full of actions and adventure in scenes not first thought of and in the logical scenes. Tonight though, my circadian rhythm is so thrown off from the past two nights going to sleep before Eleven at night. I've woken up at five thirty in the morning, and tonight twelve thirty in the morning. I tried to go back to sleep. Couldn't. Went to get food and etc., nothing helped. I decided to start coding since my ass needs to be at work at six in the morning to let the floor guy in. Yes, I will get an energy drink, and Yes, I will be productive.</p>

        <h5>Oct. 29, 2024</h5>
        <p>
	Second game of the season, Lose. We were 0-2. Also, second game without Joel Embiid, and Paul George. Not the ideal set up, I don’t want to trust the process right now, and Kelly scored a team high twenty eight points. Tyrese with the most minutes on the team, but twenty four points, only four assists, and two rebounds. Kyle Lowry is beating father time with twenty nine minutes, fourteen points, and two assists.</p>
         <p>Maxey is still slightly under performing. I do expect more from people we believe in. We were terrible on the defensive rebounding, allowing eighteen offensive rebounds. We lost every statistical battle in the box score.</p>
         <p>Third game of the season. Finally a Win!!! We are now 1-2. It did take us overtime to win. Maxey did amazingly with forty five points, only four assists, and four rebounds. Second highest scorer, Caleb with seventeen, and twelve rebounds. My boy Drummond with one point shy of a double double. I wish the home boy got it but he did show out with seventeen rebounds. We won the rebounding battle, steals, and field goals taken and made. That’s how you win a game. You have to win a couple statistical battles. Maxey did own the win, he showed up, showed out, and carried the team to the finish line. He is a super star, and takes over any game he chooses. The future is bright with this young dominant player.</p> 
         <p>Next game is the Pistons, we are at home for our second home game of the season. I hope Embiid plays, I kind of expect it because the Pistons don’t have a great big man, it's our second home game, and it’s almost an automatic win. It’s sad we have to pick low hanging fruit if this is the case, I hope it’s not. I just want to see the big man, I want the team to gain some chemistry, and I want to show the league what’s up. I just want us to live a little bit in the moment and let these guys play, they get so much money. I’m not saying the whole game. He can play half games, or just goes in to keep a rhythm. Do these players not see that they are hurting themselves in the long run? Their stats are being hurt, their legacy is being tarnished, and the fans are being cheated out of possible hall of famers. Another thought could be, are these teams sandbagging players, and hoping to fake it till you make it, type of approach. There was a song I heard recently; “One, two, three, four, five, sixers. Ten, nine, eight, seventy sixers.” I kind of like it. I wanted a song for them like we have with the Eagles. This will have to do. Email me if you know of a Sixers song that Slaps. LOL. Gen Alpha word. Lets Go Sixers!!!

        <p>First game at home, new teammates, and high hopes. But then PG8 gets hurt, with a knee injury. Which is soooooo scary. Cross fingers with his history, but I foresee him returning stronger averaging twenty something points, 6 assists, and 6 rebounds. Then Embiid planned on missing it. I heard someone say yesterday why can’t he play like twenty something minutes, for games that he needs a break, just to keep a rhythm and be out on the floor. Ain’t the saying, the best ability is availability. And you definitely don’t say out loud and before the season starts what your plan is to everyone and their mother. Mongolian’s have this word, I’m guessing the spelling, Elta. Which means in a scenario that was told to me. Imagine you have your childhood candy from Halloween. You pick out your absolute, can’t live without, favorite candy, and share, trade, whatever you want with the rest. That’s what the Sixers should have done with their information. Just give out basic shit. LOL JK. But forreal.</p> 
         <p>Next, we got the actual home opener game. We wone the first quarter. Yah! Downhill from there. Tyrese looked like he was trying very hard, which I appreciated. I felt like the refs swallowed their whistles on a couple plays with Tyrese going to the rim. My boy did score 25 points. His three assists were a little low for my taste, six to eight range is the average I hope for the young kid. Our now home boy, the mountain bike rider, and bull in a china shop mentality Kelly Oubre Jr. 21 points with a low two rebounds. I expect a lot more rebounds out of his high energy intensity and leaping ability. Closer to eight to ten rebounds for an average Kelly. On the off days if we could get Crazy Kelly, and Mad Maxey on full throttle we would look completely different then at full power, and the speed and shooting ability of the team would shine. Small ball would be massively dominant. Anchoring down on the off days would be the fun loving, hella athletic, big Andre Drummond. I love this dude in a sixers uniform. He is without a doubt the best backup for our number one man, The Process, Joel Embiid.</p>
          <p>The hopes are still high, love of the team still there, and championship attitudes never lost. Let’s go Sixers, Let’s go Philly, Let’s kick ass and dominate the league.</p>

        <p>Excited for the season. Preseason means absolutely nothing as long as no injuries. We need our guys in game shape, and rhythm. But health IS the MOST important thing to us. We have the most dominant big man in the league today. He scores more than the minutes he has. The dude is insane. He does what he wants, when he wants. Then we added PG8 now. This man is a vet that has battled with Lebron, Curry, the big 3 in Boston, and he's played with Kawahi, Westbrook, Harden, and Carmelo Anthony. He will help in crucial moments when we lacked leadership, and calm, cool, killa instinct. We were gifted a future Point Guard Hall of Famer in Maxey. Mr. Ice cold killa in Madison Square Garden. This dude is made out of Franchise Changing material. We added some youth, with finals experience in Caleb, and we added a well missed, and needed backup center in Andre, who is an acrobatic, fun hearted, and all around skilled big man in his own right. You don't know how much I love and missed Mr. Drummond. The Future is bright, the hopes are high, and the ride will be wild this season for OUR Philadelphia 76ers.</p>

        <p>Our Big Three. Did we ever think we would get here one day? We always knew we would have a number one, and maybe an up and coming prospect. But NOW! We have a legitimate Big Three now.,I feel established All Stars, PG8, Mad Maxey, The Process, Embiid. It's a win now phase which comes with a lot of pressure, but these guys laugh in the pressure. All three of these guys have gone through their own problems in life to make them resilient. PG with Indian Playoffs, wack centers, Clipper... enough said lol. Maxey droppping in the draft, luckily to us, These past years with Embiid gettting injuried in the season, and the playoff experience that hasn't been happy, which makes him the hungriest youngest mother fucker out ther. Embiid. Nothing needed.</p>

          <p>Another One. W’s are what we get. We got a bag the size of Santa Clause, full of L’s to hand out to our opponents. Barkley!!! What?!?!? That was something I had never ever seen in my LIFE. He is a once in a lifetime talent. It was wasted on the Giants. Homeboy would be a fucking record breaking Hall of Famer if he played his whole career with us. Would of, could of, should of. But we have him NOW. And that move that is ALL OVER the place, top ten, play of the week, never before seenteded, and just plain old WOW. He opens up the entire field for us due to the attention he demands from the other team. No one man can take him down.</p>
          <p>With the other team loading the box, it’s one on one all day with our Receiver! Like what. Do they know who we have?! HAHA what are they going to do? Thanks Titans. LMAO. I hope the shoulder injury is not bad for A.J. without him we are a different beast. As long as it’s not forever and a day, Devonta can carry. It’s just more hits on a small Receiver isn’t a probability I’d like to play out. Devonta and Jahan had some jaw dropping catches that were sadly outshined by the reverse hurdle over a defender by Saquon. The Penn State duo did show out this game together finally. Saquon has ALWAYS been there but it was good to see Jahan represent.</p>
          <p>Next up, Cowgirls! Jerry world, we are coming to your planet. That world is in turmoil. They overpaid their quarterback, and wide receiver. Then forgot about their Philly born Defensive phenom, Micah. We would love to see him in Kelly Green sacking the shit out of all opponents. It should be a Win, Dak is hurt, CeeDee is hurt, and they can’t stop the run. I do want a blow out though, if I’m being honest. I don’t like “America’s Team”.  I think they get recognition without earning it. They are living in the past, and praying for the future instead of living here and now, and planning for the future. LET’S GO BIRDS!!! Fly Eagles Fly! Bring home a W to add to the wall, and Hand out those L’s to lighten up our bag. LMAO!!!</p>
          <h5>Oct. 28, 2024</h5>
          <p>
	Three weeks straight, WINS!!! The first two were a little bit of a question mark because of the quality of play. But after seeing what the Browns did to the Ravens, and what we did this week to the Bengals.</p>
          <p>A win is a win. But when you have our quarterback scoring three rushing touchdowns, its like we are padding the stats. It hurts that Barkley comes out with zero touchdowns, but my boy did get one hundred and eight yards. At the end of the day if we make it to the Superbowl then it was totally worth it. In history though, Hurts is going to look like a God, when we know that he is only the product of such a talented team. Our specialty position players are top 5 in the league, and our offensive line is top 3 in the league too, when we have so many injuries. To be honest one point of view could see it from the outside looking in, that coaching could be the reason for us going in the right direction. But for the people that bleed green, we know that we got some highly skilled pro bowlers all around our team.</p>
          <p>The chunks of yard the receivers were eating up, very impressive, and wow. All three top receivers for the Eagles accomplished double digit average for yards. One touchdown amongst the three of them, the solo owner of that touchdown is Mr. Heisman, Devonta Smith. Well deserving whoever got it. But the fact that we are stacked at this position, Both receivers should have a touchdown at least and the tight end should have a touchdown also. That’ll give Hurts three passing touchdowns at least. So, let’s turn these rushing touchdowns by Hurts into passing touchdowns, and one at least for Barkley. We are looking better, but we are settling. I feel like on this “Brotherly Shove” to score. Yes we are on the goal line, and yes it is almost guaranteed at this point, but our players need to be rewarded. And not like Jalen is being rewarded for the inability to pass it in, or for some reason won’t let our running back get in. How can you not mention that one TD pass. The beautifully thrown ball ended up in the shadows, so it’s easier to see. The exceptional concentration by Mr. Smith, with a defender draped over him. Finally the hand to catch that ball, they weren’t feet. LOL. IYKYK.</p>
         <p>D-Fence! They have been stepping up. We had an interception, and one sack. Not huge numbers, but when you are watching, it shows you a different story. Cincinnati had less first downs than us, less total yards, and one fumble for a loss. P.s. Eagles had Zero turn overs. The new blood is showing out. I’m a little worried about Slay Sr. and his injury. We need his leadership, and play making skills. I hope he returns soon and better than ever. Fly Eagles Fly!

          <p>Saquon Barkley going back to his old home where he was drafted, and just over the bridge from his new/old home, Fly Eagles Fly. Saquon dominated with one hundred seventy six yards, from seventeen carries, but only one touchdown. I get it, brotherly shove, and all that, but maybe starting to practice with Saquon or Brown hiking the ball could add a dynamic aspect to the play. I also want to make known that I know our home boy Hurts squats more than most people on planet earth. But since the play is so forsure, why not share the love of a touchdown score. Our superstar gift, given to us by the Titans, and pink shoe wearing, Mr. A.J. Brown. With eighty nine yards, one touchdown, and five targets with five catches. Our boy dominated with his forty one yard, longest catch of the day, mastery of a game. I always have to mention the singing, loving, body moving, teamwork operating, strongest men on the field offensive linemen. They did the expected, best in the league, phenomenal protection of Mr. number one on his jersey and number one in Philadelphians’ heart, Jalen Hurts. Only one hundred fourteen yards, one touchdown thrown, two rushed with twenty two yards rushing. With the weapons we have and the new coordinators on the team I want more yards throwing, less rushing touchdowns because he’s completing drives with passing touchdowns, or our new Pennsylvania raised Saquon getting the opportunity to finish drives with a short yard run when we are on the goal line no matter first, second, third or fourth down. Lastly, our defense. They finally got the sacks that we envisioned even though the hall of fame Vet leaving the D-line will forever be missed. Carter is the one I like, he just seems more promising than Davis. Big guys usually have injury problems like Davis. One guy that comes to mind that was that big but was always on the field was Mr. Wilfork. Carter is strong, quick, and intelligent with his enthusiastic, new age approach to the game. Not seeing much from the rookie CB, and Swiss Army Knife Dejean. Sometimes no news is good news, with defensive backs. If it's quiet with them and their wide receiver counterpart it’s good. Fly Eagles Fly, continue getting better and let Saquon eat, he hungry and he’s the vehicle that takes us to the Superbowl to kick Kansas City’s non three peat asses.</p>
          <h5>Oct. 13, 2024</h5>
        <p>Eagles get a win! 3-2. A.J. Brown is back! Boy oh boy we missed him. Yes it was the Browns, but watching the game you could see he was the comfort blanket that the team was missing. We also saw who's team this is. The game leader. A.J. Brown 116 yards, Saquon who I love, but 47 rushing yards. 2-0 with A.J. Do you need more? Jalen Hurts 264 yards, and 2 TDs. His game elevated. Going into the bye with a W, and getting off of a bye, we are 4-0 with Jalen Hurts at the helm. Consistency is the problem with us Eagles, but keeping that consistency ain't bad.</p>

        <p>Eagles are struggling now. We are 2-2. Bad, bad, very bad loss to the Bucs. I know we were down players, leaders, but we should have focused on our weapons that are on the field. We got all these weapons for this moment of the season when injuries come into effect. We easily have top 10 in all the skilled positions, RB, WR, WR2, TE, QB, Ts, C, but we either have an injury in those positions or they are under performing. The whole league, the world, knows that these players can play better.</p>
